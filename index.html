  A Boutique Fan Experience
</h3>

<p>
  Welcome to the <strong><em>Ivalice Alliance</em></strong> community! We are a group of fans who are passionate about
  discussing all things interesting and unique, from video games and anime to music and bar culture. Our community is
  inspired by the iconic Final Fantasy franchise, and as such, we have a character system where members can pick a name
  from the series as their persona. This adds an extra layer of fun and immersion to our conversations, which extend
  beyond just Final Fantasy. We enjoy talking about a wide range of other topics as well.
</p>

<p>
  One of the things that sets our community apart is that we operate as a small Discord server. This intimate setting
  fosters a tight knit and supportive atmosphere, allowing members to easily connect and engage with one another. The
  benefits of a small server include more meaningful interactions, closer relationships, and the chance to be heard in
  conversations without being drowned out by a large number of participants. It also helps to cultivate a genuine sense
  of camaraderie among members.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you're a fan of the series or just looking for a place to chat about your interests with like minded people,
  you'll find a welcoming and inclusive community in our small server. We embrace diversity and respect all members,
  regardless of their background or level of knowledge. So come on in, pick your character, and join the conversation!
  We can't wait to get to know you and discuss all of our shared interests within this cozy and friendly environment.
