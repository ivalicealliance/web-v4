  Community of Fans
</h3>

<p>
  Welcome to the <strong><em>Ivalice Alliance</em></strong> community! We are a group of fans who are passionate about
  discussing all things interesting and unique, from video
  games and anime to music and bar culture. Our community is inspired by the iconic Final Fantasy franchise, and as
  such, we have a character system where members can pick a name from the series as their persona. This adds an extra
  layer of fun and immersion to our conversations, which extend beyond just Final Fantasy. We enjoy talking about a wide
  range of other topics as well.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you're a fan of the series or just looking for a place to chat about your interests with like-minded people,
  you'll find a welcoming and inclusive community. We embrace diversity and respect all
  members, regardless of their background or level of knowledge. So come on in, pick your character, and join the
  conversation! We can't wait to get to know you and discuss all of our shared interests.
