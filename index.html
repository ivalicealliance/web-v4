  A Boutique Fan Experience
</h3>

<p>
  Welcome to the <strong><em>Ivalice Alliance</em></strong> community! We're a group of fans who enjoy discussing all
  things interesting, from video games and anime to music and bar culture. Inspired by the iconic Final Fantasy
  franchise, we use a character system where members can pick a name from the series as their persona, adding an extra
  layer of fun to our conversations. While Final Fantasy is a common theme, we also chat about a variety of other
  topics.
</p>

<p>
  Our community operates as a small Discord server, offering a relaxed and engaging space where members can easily
  connect. A smaller setting allows for more meaningful conversations, ensures everyone has a voice, and fosters a
  strong sense of camaraderie.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you're a long-time Final Fantasy fan or just looking for a place to chat with others who share your interests,
  you're welcome here. Pick a character, join the discussion, and enjoy the conversation!
